# MACAddress
Return MACAddress of a computer under matlab/Octave

mac = MACAddress(); % default returns first mac address as char

mac = MACAddress(1); % if input true, returns all mac address as cell str

The MACAddress.m file should work by itself. Those mex files are for Windows only now, and can be very faster if included.
